# Jakarta Smart City Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Jakarta Smart City dataset**, focusing on identifying patterns, relationships, and insights that can guide urban decision-making. The analysis explores correlations between population density, education, economic factors, and infrastructure quality across Jakarta’s regions.  

## Objectives
- Examine patterns and trends in Jakarta's urban environment

- Identify correlations between transportation, air quality, population dynamics, and waste management

- Provide practical recommendations for improving sustainability and operational efficiency

## Key Insights & Conculsion

- Traffic Congestion and Air Quality: Slower traffic speeds are directly linked to increased PM2.5 levels, highlighting the importance of sustainable traffic management to reduce emissions.

- Public Engagement as an Indicator: Citizen complaints can act as a proxy for environmental stress, providing valuable real-time insights for city authorities.

- Waste Management Independence: Waste generation patterns appear largely unaffected by air or traffic variables, implying a need for separate policy considerations in that domain.

- Data Integration Value: Combining environmental and civic datasets enables a more holistic understanding of Jakarta’s urban dynamics and supports data-driven decision-making within Smart City initiatives.

The findings highlight that sustainable growth in Jakarta requires a balanced focus on:
- Reducing vehicular emissions,
- Enhancing waste management systems, and
- Distributing urban infrastructure more evenly across districts.


## Tools & Libraries  
This project was conducted using:  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – regression and statistical modeling

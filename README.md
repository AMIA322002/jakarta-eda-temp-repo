# 🏙️ Jakarta Smart City Data Analysis  

## 📊 Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Jakarta Smart City dataset**, focusing on identifying patterns, relationships, and insights that can guide urban decision-making. The analysis explores correlations between population density, education, economic factors, and infrastructure quality across Jakarta’s regions.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
The main objectives of this project are to:  
- Analyze and visualize key urban indicators to understand socio-economic dynamics.  
- Examine relationships between education, employment, and infrastructure quality.  
- Identify districts with potential for development and improvement.  
- Provide data-driven insights that can support Jakarta Smart City’s policy decisions.  

## 🧠 Key Analyses  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data cleaning, transformation, and feature inspection.  
   - Visualization of regional distributions using bar charts, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.  

2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Pearson correlation is used to evaluate the strength of linear relationships between numeric features.  
   - Insights into how education, employment, and income levels interact with infrastructure and population metrics.  

3. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Linear regression applied to assess predictive relationships among selected variables.  
   - Model evaluation using metrics such as R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).  
   - Interpretation focused on understanding how independent variables influence outcomes rather than predictive deployment.  

## 📈 Results & Insights  
- Strong correlations were observed between **education and income**, highlighting the economic impact of educational access.  
- Regions with **higher infrastructure quality** also tend to have **lower unemployment rates**, suggesting equitable resource distribution may improve employment opportunities.  
- The regression model confirms that **education level and employment rate** are significant predictors of income disparities across Jakarta’s districts.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
This project was conducted using:  
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – regression and statistical modeling
